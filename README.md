Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.


### This repository includes:
<ul>
<li>a .R file (R script) named on run_Analysis.R </li>
<li>a .md file (codebook) named on CodeBook.md</li>
</ul>

### The R script run_Analysis.R does the following.
<ul>
<li>Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. </li>
<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. </li>
<li>Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>the code book <strong> CodeBook.md </strong>describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data</p>
